# MQTT-Controlled-Smarthome
Oulu University of Applied Sciences, second year communications application project by Pekka Rajala, Aki Sepp√§nen and Eemeli Tikka

In this project we had four Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 devices working as different parts of a Smarthome environment.

- Temperature sensor with DHT11
- Lights represented by a LED with an LDR-sensor
- 12v fan powered by and external power source and controlled with a mosfet. (During testing we used a 9v battery as the power source)
- Door alarm with a buzzer

We had a Raspbery pi 3 working as a WiFi-hotspot, Mqtt broker(Mosquitto), Mysql database and website host for the end devices.
